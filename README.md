## Project Name
Pizza Ordering Website

## Features
This page will allow the user to pick a size and topping for a pizza and have a price for purchase returned to them.

## About Page
This is based on a friend of mine's shop in Taiwan. It is not a real order form. The pictures of the pizza are real. I can tell you they are amazing! If you are ever in Taiwan go to the address listed in the header ;)

## Specifications

The default pizza will be a small cheese pizza for 100NTD.

1. If the user chooses a medium pizza, 100NTD will be added to the base price of 100NTD.
2. If the user chooses a large pizza, 200NTD will be added to the base price of 100NTD.
3. If the user chooses chorizo as a topping, 100NTD will be added to the base price of 100NTD.
4. If the user chooses vichingo, 200NTD will be added to the base price of 100NTD.

So the price for a medium cheese pizza would be 200NTD.
The price for a large vichingo would be 500NTD.
